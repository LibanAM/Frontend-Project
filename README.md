# Summary
This is the front-end for the [ JustListen back-end project](https://github.com/patrick-merchant/backend-project) which was orignally produced by [Patrick](), [Ana]() and [Sabina](). It is an app that can search for podcasts by your favourite presenters, guests and categories. You can also get a random podcast recommendation and users can recieve 3 random recommendations for podcasts they have not listened to before.

This project was the front-end group project to utilise the previously developed back-end project from another group with the intention to work with an unseen API and develop a React front-end for it.

This front-end project was built using HTML, CSS and ReactJs

# Step-by-step instructions for initial set up

1. Clone this repository : `git clone git@github.com:LibanAM/Frontend-Project.git` 

2. Open the *server-side* repo [backend-project](https://github.com/LibanAM/Frontend-Project/tree/main/backend-project) in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application
    - the server port should configure to 8080 by default

3. Open the *client-side* repo [frontend-project](https://github.com/LibanAM/Frontend-Project/tree/main/frontend-project) in Visual Studio Code and run `npm install` to install the required node modules

4. Run the front-end application using `npm start` where it should run the application on localhost:3000

5. Double check you are not running the production build by checking the console log in your browser telling you to make sure the server is running on port 8080
